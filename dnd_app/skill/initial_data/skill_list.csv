Name;Ability;Trained Only;Armor Check Penalty;Link;Description
Appraise;Intelligence;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/appraise.htm;You can appraise common or well-known objects with a DC 12 Appraise check. Failure means that you estimate the value at 50% to 150% (2d6+3 times 10%,) of its actual value. Appraising a rare or exotic item requires a successful check against DC 15, 20, or higher. If the check is successful, you estimate the value correctly, failure means you cannot estimate the item's value. A magnifying glass gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed, such as a gem. A merchant's scale gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals. These bonuses stack.
Balance;Dexterity;False;True;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/balance.htm;You can walk on a precarious surface. A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can't move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall.
Bluff;Charisma;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/bluff.htm;A Bluff check is opposed by the target's Sense Motive check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target's Sense Motive check for each one. Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it's important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn't so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff. A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a suggestion spell. A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.
Climb;Strength;False;True;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/climb.htm;With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees, a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more. A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained. A climber's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks. You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can't move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can't use a shield while climbing. Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.
Concentration;Constitution;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/concentration.htm;You must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn't normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted. If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check may have other ramifications as well. The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each one, any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not completed.
Craft (Placeholder/Example);Intelligence;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/craft.htm;You can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft's daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.) The basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type.

Decipher Script;Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/decipherScript.htm;You can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard texts, and 30 or higher for intricate, exotic, or very old writing. If the check succeeds, you understand the general content of a piece of writing about one page long (or the equivalent). If the check fails, make a DC 5 Wisdom check to see if you avoid drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that you do not draw a false conclusion, failure means that you do.) Both the Decipher Script check and (if necessary) the Wisdom check are made secretly, so that you can't tell whether the conclusion you draw is true or false.
Diplomacy;Charisma;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/diplomacy.htm;You can change the attitudes of others (nonplayer characters) with a successful Diplomacy check, see the Influencing NPC Attitudes sidebar, below, for basic DCs. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks, and the winner gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve situations when two advocates or diplomats plead opposite cases in a hearing before a third party.
Disable Device;Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/disableDevice.htm;The Disable Device check is made secretly, so that you don't necessarily know whether you've succeeded. The DC depends on how tricky the device is. Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10, more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs. If the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you're attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally. You also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).
Disguise;Charisma;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/disguise.htm;Your Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is, and it is opposed by others' Spot check results. If you don't draw any attention to yourself, others do not get to make Spot checks. If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their Spot checks. You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people are making Spot checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can't be sure how good the result is. The effectiveness of your disguise depends in part on how much you're attempting to change your appearance. If you are impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like get a bonus on their Spot checks according to the table below. Furthermore, they are automatically considered to be suspicious of you, so opposed checks are always called for. Usually, an individual makes a Spot check to see through your disguise immediately upon meeting you and each hour thereafter. If you casually meet many different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Spot modifier for the group.
Escape Artist;Dexterity;False;True;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/escapeArtist.htm;Making an Escape Artist check to escape from rope bindings, manacles, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute of work. Escaping from a net or an animate rope, command plants, control plants, or entangle spell is a full-round action. Escaping from a grapple or pin is a standard action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on how long the space is.
Forgery;Intelligence;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/forgery.htm;Forgery requires writing materials appropriate to the document being forged, enough light or sufficient visual acuity to see the details of what you're writing, wax for seals (if appropriate), and some time. To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check. To forge a signature, you need an autograph of that person to copy, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. To forge a longer document written in the hand of some particular person, a large sample of that person's handwriting is needed. The Forgery check is made secretly, so that you're not sure how good your forgery is. As with Disguise, you don't even need to make a check until someone examines the work. Your Forgery check is opposed by the Forgery check of the person who examines the document to check its authenticity. The examiner gains modifiers on his or her check if any of the conditions on the table below exist. A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that requires sacrifice on the part of the person checking the document can increase that character's suspicion (and thus create favorable circumstances for the checker's opposing Forgery check).
Gather Information;Charisma;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/gatherInformation.htm;An evening's time, a few gold pieces for buying drinks and making friends, and a DC 10 Gather Information check get you a general idea of a city's major news items, assuming there are no obvious reasons why the information would be withheld. The higher your check result, the better the information. If you want to find out about a specific rumor, or a specific item, or obtain a map, or do something else along those lines, the DC for the check is 15 to 25, or even higher.
Handle Animal;Charisma;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/handleAnimal.htm;This task involves commanding an animal to perform a task or trick that it knows. If the animal is wounded or has taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.
Heal;Wisdom;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/heal.htm;Providing first aid, treating a wound, or treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.
Hide;Dexterity;False;True;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/hide.htm;Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging. A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large -4, Huge -8, Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16. You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or total concealment usually (but not always, see Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway. If people are observing you, even casually, you can't hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you're out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went. If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check, see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you have to move fast.
Intimidate;Charisma;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/intimidate.htm;You can change another's behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if any] + target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6 x 10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target's default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile). If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.
Jump;Strength;False;True;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/jump.htm;The DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below). Your Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet. All Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled. Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round. If you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.
Knowledge (Arcana);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)
Knowledge (Architecture and Engineering);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)
Knowledge (Dungeoneering);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;Dungeoneering (underground hazards, subterranean creatures)
Knowledge (Geography);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)
Knowledge (History);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)
Knowledge (Local);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)
Knowledge (Nature);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)
Knowledge (Nobility and Royalty);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, personalities)
Knowledge (Religion);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)
Knowledge (The Planes);Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm;The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes)
Listen;Wisdom;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/listen.htm;Your Listen check is either made against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that you might hear, or it is opposed by your target's Move Silently check. In the case of people trying to be quiet, the DCs given on the table could be replaced by Move Silently checks, in which case the indicated DC would be their average check result.
Move Silently;Dexterity;False;True;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/moveSilently.htm;Your Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your full speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 penalty) to move silently while running or charging. Noisy surfaces, such as bogs or undergrowth, are tough to move silently across. When you try to sneak across such a surface, you take a penalty on your Move Silently check as indicated below.
Open Lock;Dexterity;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/openLock.htm;Attempting an Open Lock check without a set of thieves' tools imposes a -2 circumstance penalty on the check, even if a simple tool is employed. If you use masterwork thieves' tools, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.
Perform (Placeholder/Example);Charisma;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/perform.htm;Placeholder for some perform skill
Perform (Act);Charisma;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/perform.htm;Act (comedy, drama, mime)

Perform (Wind);Charisma;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/perform.htm;Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)
Perform (Sing);Charisma;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/perform.htm;Sing (ballad, chant, melody)
Profession (Placeholder/Example);Wisdom;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/profession.htm;Like Craft, Knowledge, and Perform, Profession is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Profession skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill. While a Craft skill represents ability in creating or making an item, a Profession skill represents an aptitude in a vocation requiring a broader range of less specific knowledge.
Ride;Dexterity;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/ride.htm;Typical riding actions don't require checks. You can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount from a mount without a problem.
Search;Intelligence;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/search.htm;You generally must be within 10 feet of the object or surface to be searched.
Sense Motive;Wisdom;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/senseMotive.htm;A successful check lets you avoid being bluffed. You can also use this skill to determine when “something is up�  (that is, something odd is going on) or to assess someone's trustworthiness.
Sleight of Hand;Dexterity;True;True;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/sleightOfHand.htm;A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where the item went. When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer's Spot check. The observer's success doesn't prevent you from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed. You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone observing you or the Search check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains a +4 bonus on the Search check, since it's generally easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check. Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a Spot check to detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the attempt, regardless of whether you got the item. You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as though you were using the Perform skill. In such a case, your “act�  encompasses elements of legerdemain, juggling, and the like.
Spellcraft;Intelligence;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/spellcraft.htm;Use this skill to identify spells as they are cast or spells already in place.
Spot;Wisdom;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/spot.htm;The Spot skill is used primarily to detect characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is necessary to notice it. A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an invisible creature near you, though you can't actually see it. Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise, and to read lips when you can't hear or understand what someone is saying. Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).
Survival;Wisdom;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/survival.htm;You can keep yourself and others safe and fed in the wild. The table below gives the DCs for various tasks that require Survival checks.
Swim;Strength;False;True;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/swim.htm;Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to one-half your speed (as a full-round action) or at one-quarter your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater. If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your Constitution score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the Constitution check, you begin to drown.
Tumble;Dexterity;True;True;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/tumble.htm;You can't use this skill if your speed has been reduced by armor, excess equipment, or loot. You can land softly when you fall or tumble past opponents. You can also tumble to entertain an audience (as though using the Perform skill).
Use Magic Device;Charisma;True;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/useMagicDevice.htm;You can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different alignment. You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour. You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose.
Use Rope;Dexterity;False;False;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/useRope.htm;Most tasks with a rope are relatively simple. The DCs for various tasks utilizing this skill are summarized on the table below.
