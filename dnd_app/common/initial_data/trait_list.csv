Cannot heal damage naturally (Construct);Cannot heal damage on their own, but often can be repaired by exposing them to a certain kind of effect (see the creature's description for details) or through the use of the Craft Construct feat.

No dual nature (Elemental);Unlike most other living creatures, an elemental does not have a dual nature—its soul and body form one unit. When an elemental is slain, no soul is set loose. Spells that restore souls to their bodies, such as raise dead, reincarnate, and resurrection, don't work on an elemental. It takes a different magical effect, such as limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection, to restore it to life.;;Other

Tongues (Su) (Angel);All angels can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a tongues spell (caster level equal to angel's Hit Dice). This ability is always active.;;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Aura of Menace (Su) (Archon);A righteous aura surrounds archons that fight or get angry. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of an archon must succeed on a Will save to resist its effects. The save DC varies with the type of archon, is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Those who fail take a -2 penalty on attacks, AC, and saves for 24 hours or until they successfully hit the archon that generated the aura. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by the same archon's aura for 24 hours.;;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Magic Circle against Evil (Su) (Archon);A magic circle against evil effect always surrounds an archon (caster level equals the archon's Hit Dice).;;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Teleport (Su) (Archon);Archons can use greater teleport at will, as the spell (caster level 14th), except that the creature can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects.;;Supernatural Ability (Su)

Fast Movement (Ex) (Barbarian);A barbarian's land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian's speed because of any load carried or armor worn.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#barbarianFastMovement;Movement
Illiteracy (Barbarian);Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak. A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#illiteracy;Other
Rage (Ex) (Barbarian);A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian's hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character's (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can't charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies). A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else's action.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#rage;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Spell Resistance (Ex);Spell resistance is the Extraordinary Ability (Ex) to avoid being affected by spells. (Some spells also grant spell resistance.) To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) at least equal to the creatures spell resistance. (The defenders spell resistance is like an Armor Class against magical attacks.) If the caster fails the check, the spell doesnt affect the creature. The possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell resistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its spell resistance to operate. Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some abilities that are subject to spell resistance and some that are not. Even some spells ignore spell resistance, see When Spell Resistance Applies, below. A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing so is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the creatures next turn. At the beginning of the creatures next turn, the creatures spell resistance automatically returns unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity). A creatures spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or abilities. A creature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to others by touching them or standing in their midst. Only the rarest of creatures and a few magic items have the ability to bestow spell resistance upon another. Spell resistance does not stack. It overlaps.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellResistance;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Uncanny Dodge (Ex);A character retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a character already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#uncannyDodge;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Trap Sense (Ex);A character gains a bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#trapSense;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex);A character no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has levels in class that gives this ability. If a character already has uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#improvedUncannyDodge;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Damage Reduction (Ex);A creature with this special quality ignores damage from most weapons and natural attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the attack was ineffective). The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks (even nonmagical ones), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. A certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage the creature normally, as noted below. The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the ability.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Greater Rage (Ex) (Barbarian);A barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#greaterRage;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Indomitable Will (Ex) (Barbarian);While in a rage, a barbarian gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#indomitableWill;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Tireless Rage (Ex) (Barbarian);A barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#tirelessRage;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Mighty Rage (Ex) (Barbarian);A barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm#mightyRage;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Specific Weapon Proficiency;;;Proficiency
Specific Armor Proficiency;;;Proficiency
Bardic Knowledge (Bard);A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.) A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check, this sort of knowledge is essentially random.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#bardicKnowledge;Other
Bardic Music (Bard);Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify, if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks. Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn't require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), spell trigger (such as wands), or command word. Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#bardicMusic;Other
Countersong (Su) (Bard);A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard's Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard's Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don't allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#countersong;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Fascinate (Sp) (Bard);A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability. To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature's Will save against the effect. If a creature's saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a -4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#fascinate;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Inspire Courage (Su) (Bard);A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#inspireCourage;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Inspire Competence (Su) (Bard); bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard's music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can't inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#inspireCompetence;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Suggestion (Sp) (Bard);A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated. Using this ability does not break the bard's concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect. Making a suggestion doesn't count against a bard's daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard's level + bard's Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#suggestion;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Inspire Greatness (Su) (Bard);A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target's Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#inspireGreatness;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Song of Freedom (Sp) (Bard);A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the break enchantment spell (caster level equals the character's bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can't use song of freedom on himself.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#songOfFreedom;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Inspire Heroics (Su) (Bard);A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#inspireHeroics;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Mass Suggestion (Sp) (Bard);This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated. Mass suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm#massSuggestion;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su) (Cleric);Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead). A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells. A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/cleric.htm#turnorRebukeUndead;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Animal Companion (Ex) (Druid);A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind. A 1st-level druid's companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal's power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished. A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals. Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.);https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#animalCompanion;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Nature Sense (Ex);A Character gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#natureSense;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Wild Empathy (Ex);Character improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The character rolls 1d20 and adds her level of the class that gave this ability and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly. To use wild empathy, the character and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time. A character can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#wildEmpathy;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Woodland Stride (Ex);Character may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#woodlandStride;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Trackless Step (Ex);Character leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#tracklessStep;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Resist Nature's Lure (Ex);Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#resistNaturesLure;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Wild Shape (Su) (Druid);At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the alternate form special ability, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. Each time you use wild shape, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a night. Any gear worn or carried by the druid melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When the druid reverts to her true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on her body that they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items worn in the assumed form fall off and land at the druid's feet. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with. A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.) A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level. The new form's Hit Dice can't exceed the character's druid level. At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can't use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn't a creature.) At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental's feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type. At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#resistNaturesLure;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Venom Immunity (Ex);;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#venomImmunity;Immunity
A Thousand Faces (Su);At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the disguise self spell, but only while in her normal form. This affects the druid's body but not her possessions. It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid's appearance, within the limits described for the spell.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#aThousandFaces;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Timeless Body (Ex);Character no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the character still dies of old age when her time is up.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm#timelessBody;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Fighter Bonus Feat;At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats. A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums. These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. A fighter is not limited to the list of fighter bonus feats when choosing these feats.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm#bonusFeats;Feat
Monk Bonus Feat;At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#bonusFeat;Feat
Unarmed Strike (Monk);At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk's attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes. Usually a monk's unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling. A monk's unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons. A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage, see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#unarmedStrike;Other
Evasion (Ex);A successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#monkEvasion;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Still Mind (Ex);A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#stillMind;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Ki Strike (Su) (Monk);At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character's monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#kiStrike;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Slow Fall (Ex);A character within arm's reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were shorter than it actually is.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#slowFall;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Improved Evasion (Ex);A character's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless character does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#monkImprovedEvasion;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Diamond Body (Su) (Monk);At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#diamondBody;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Abundant Step (Su) (Monk);At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door, once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#abundantStep;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Diamond Soul (Ex) (Monk);At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk's spell resistance.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#diamondSoul;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Quivering Palm (Su) (Monk);Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#quiveringPalm;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex) (Monk);A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#tongueoftheSunandMoon;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Empty Body (Su) (Monk);At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell etherealness. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#emptyBody;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Perfect Self (Monk);At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk's creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/monk.htm#perfectSelf;Other
Aura of Good (Ex) (Paladin);The power of a paladin's aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#auraOfGood;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Detect Evil (Sp) (Paladin);At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#detectEvil;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Smite Evil (Su) (Paladin);Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day. At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.;;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Divine Grace (Su) (Paladin);At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#divineGrace;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Lay on Hands (Su) (Paladin);Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level × her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn't have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action. Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#layOnHands;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Aura of Courage (Su) (Paladin);Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#auraOfCourage;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Divine Health (Ex) (Paladin);At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#divineHealth;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Turn Undead (Su) (Paladin);When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#turnUndead;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Special Mount (Sp) (Paladin);Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil. This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin). Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin's level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level, it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a particular mount from service. Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect. Should the paladin's mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#specialMount;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Remove Disease (Sp) (Paladin);At 6th level, a paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm#removeDisease;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Favored Enemy (Ex);At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger's bonuses do not stack, he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm#favoredEnemy;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Bonus Feat;Gain a specific bonus feat;;Feat
Combat Style (Ex);At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character's class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way. If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm#combatStyle;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Animal Companion (Ex) (Ranger);At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the ranger's list of options: manta ray, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger's effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm#animalCompanion;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Improved Combat Style (Ex) (Ranger);At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm#improvedCombatStyle;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Swift Tracker (Ex) (Ranger);Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm#swiftTracker;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Combat Style Mastery (Ex) (Ranger);At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm#combatStyleMastery;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Camouflage (Ex) (Ranger);A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn't grant cover or concealment.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm#camouflage;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Hide in Plain Sight (Ex);While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm#hideInPlainSight;Extraordinary Ability (Ex)
Enhance Arrow (Su) (Arcane Archer);At 1st level, every nonmagical arrow an arcane archer nocks and lets fly becomes magical, gaining a +1 enhancement bonus. Unlike magic weapons created by normal means, the archer need not spend experience points or gold pieces to accomplish this task. However, an archer's magic arrows only function for her. For every two levels the character advances past 1st level in the prestige class, the magic arrows she creates gain +1 greater potency (+1 at 1st level, +2 at 3rd level, +3 at 5th level, +4 at 7th level, and +5 at 9th level).;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/arcaneArcher.htm#enhanceArrow;Supernatural Ability (Su)
Imbue Arrow (Sp) (Arcane Archer);At 2nd level, an arcane archer gains the ability to place an area spell upon an arrow. When the arrow is fired, the spell's area is centered on where the arrow lands, even if the spell could normally be centered only on the caster. This ability allows the archer to use the bow's range rather than the spell's range. It takes a standard action to cast the spell and fire the arrow. The arrow must be fired in the round the spell is cast, or the spell is wasted.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/arcaneArcher.htm#imbueArrow;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Seeker Arrow (Sp) (Arcane Archer);At 4th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the arrow's range prevents the arrow's flight. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/arcaneArcher.htm#seekerArrow;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Phase Arrow (Sp) (Arcane Archer);At 6th level, an arcane archer can launch an arrow once per day at a target known to her within range, and the arrow travels to the target in a straight path, passing through any nonmagical barrier or wall in its way. (Any magical barrier stops the arrow.) This ability negates cover, concealment, and even armor modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. Using this ability is a standard action (and shooting the arrow is part of the action).;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/arcaneArcher.htm#phaseArrow;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Hail of Arrows (Sp) (Arcane Archer);In lieu of her regular attacks, once per day an arcane archer of 8th level or higher can fire an arrow at each and every target within range, to a maximum of one target for every arcane archer level she has earned. Each attack uses the archer's primary attack bonus, and each enemy may only be targeted by a single arrow.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/arcaneArcher.htm#hailOfArrows;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Arrow of Death (Sp) (Arcane Archer);At 10th level, an arcane archer can create an arrow of death that forces the target, if damaged by the arrow's attack, to make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slain immediately. It takes one day to make an arrow of death, and the arrow only functions for the arcane archer who created it. The arrow of death lasts no longer than one year, and the archer can only have one such arrow in existence at a time.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/arcaneArcher.htm#arrowOfDeath;Spell-like Ability (Sp)
Ranged Legerdemain (Arcane Trickster);An arcane trickster can perform one of the following class skills at a range of 30 feet: Disable Device, Open Lock, or Sleight of Hand. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by 5, and an arcane trickster cannot take 10 on this check. Any object to be manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. An arcane trickster can use ranged legerdemain once per day initially, twice per day upon attaining 5th level, and three times per day at 9th level or higher. He can make only one ranged legerdemain skill check each day, and only if he has at least 1 rank in the skill being used.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/arcaneTrickster.htm#rangedLegerdemain;Other
Sneak Attack;If a character can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The character's attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the character flanks her target. Should the character score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a character can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty. A character can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies—undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The character must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A character cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/rogue.htm#sneakAttack;Damage
Impromptu Sneak Attack (Arcane Trickster);Beginning at 3rd level, once per day an arcane trickster can declare one melee or ranged attack he makes to be a sneak attack (the target can be no more than 30 feet distant if the impromptu sneak attack is a ranged attack). The target of an impromptu sneak attack loses any Dexterity bonus to AC, but only against that attack. The power can be used against any target, but creatures that are not subject to critical hits take no extra damage (though they still lose any Dexterity bonus to AC against the attack). At 7th level, an arcane trickster can use this ability twice per day.;https://www.d20srd.org/srd/prestigeClasses/arcaneTrickster.htm#impromptuSneakAttack;Other
